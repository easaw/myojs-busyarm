> North (formerly Thalmic Labs), the creator of the Myo armband, was acquired by Google in June 2020. Myo sales ended in October 2018 and Myo software, hardware and SDKs are no longer available or supported. [Learn more.](https://support.getmyo.com)

A plugin for [Myo.js](https://github.com/thalmiclabs/myo.js) that detects when your arm is busy.

**[See it in action here](http://thalmiclabs.github.io/myojs-busyarm/demo/)** <small>(requires a myo!)</small>

`busyarm.myo.js` will emit a `arm_busy` event when the arm becomes busy and a `arm_rest` event when the arm is at rest. The variable `myo.isArmBusy` is a boolean that tracks what state the arm is in.

The library uses a [Exponential moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average) to smooth the gyroscope data. If the EMA goes above a certain threshold, the arm is considered busy.

```
Myo.on('arm_busy', function(){
	console.log('You are quite the hand talker');
});
Myo.on('fist', function(){
	if(!this.isArmBusy){
		this.trigger('calm_fist');
	}
})
```

Check out the [demo](/demo/index.html) for an example of how to use it.

#### configuration

```
Myo.plugins.busyarm = {
	threshold : 80,     //The threshold the EMA has to pass to be considered busy
	ema_alpha : 0.05,   //The coefficient for smoothing the EMA of the gyro data
};
```

You can use the demo to get an idea of a good threshold for you while doing different actions.
